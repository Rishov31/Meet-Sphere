/*
EXPLAINATION 1--
  üõ† Code Overview
javascript
Copy
Edit
const [matchingRoom, found] = Object.entries(connections).reduce(
  ([room, isFound], [roomKey, roomValue]) => {
    if (!isFound && roomValue.includes(socket.id)) {
      return [roomKey, true];
    }
    return [room, isFound];
  },
  ["", false]
);
Goal: Find the chatroom (matchingRoom) that contains the sender‚Äôs socket.id.
Approach: Uses reduce() to iterate over the connections object and find the room where the sender exists.
üîπ Step 1: Understand connections
The connections object stores room names as keys and an array of connected users (socket IDs) as values.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
connections = {
  "room1": ["socket1", "socket2"],
  "room2": ["socket3", "socket4"]
}
socket1 and socket2 are in "room1".
socket3 and socket4 are in "room2".
üîπ Step 2: Convert connections to an array
Object.entries(connections)
This converts connections into an array of key-value pairs:

[
  ["room1", ["socket1", "socket2"]],
  ["room2", ["socket3", "socket4"]]
]
Each element is [roomKey, roomValue], where:

roomKey is "room1" or "room2".
roomValue is the array of socket IDs.
üîπ Step 3: Using reduce()
Syntax of reduce()
js
Copy
Edit
array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => { ... }, initialValue)
Here:

Accumulator: [room, isFound]
Current value: [roomKey, roomValue]
Initial value: ["", false]
Breaking Down the reduce() Function
js
Copy
Edit
([room, isFound], [roomKey, roomValue]) => {
room: Stores the matching room name (starts as "").
isFound: Boolean flag (false initially) to track if we found the sender's room.
üîπ Step 4: Checking if the User Exists in a Room
js
Copy
Edit
if (!isFound && roomValue.includes(socket.id)) {
  return [roomKey, true];
}
roomValue.includes(socket.id): Checks if the user‚Äôs socket ID exists in the current room‚Äôs list.
!isFound: Ensures that once we find the room, we don't keep searching.
If the socket ID is found, return this room (roomKey) and set isFound to true.
üîπ Step 5: If Not Found, Keep the Previous Values
js
Copy
Edit
return [room, isFound];
If the socket ID is not found, return the previous room and found status.
üîπ Step 6: The Initial Value
js
Copy
Edit
["", false]
Starts with an empty string for room and false for isFound.

üîπ Example Execution
Imagine socket2 sends a message.

üîπ Iteration 1
Checking "room1" ‚Üí ["socket1", "socket2"]
socket2 is in this room ‚úÖ
Returns ["room1", true]
üîπ Iteration 2
Checking "room2" ‚Üí ["socket3", "socket4"]
socket2 is not here ‚ùå
Stops searching because isFound === true.
Final Output:

matchingRoom = "room1";
found = true;
‚ú® Summary
This code efficiently finds the room a user belongs to by: ‚úÖ Looping through all rooms.
‚úÖ Checking if the socket ID exists in a room.
‚úÖ Returning only the first match (ignoring the rest).
